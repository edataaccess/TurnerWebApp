Turner Dev Challenge

from 'readme.md' inside Code folder
Notes:
The intent here is to enter a search value, navigate to FetchTitles,
get the search value, have the GetTitlesAsync executed, then render
the result list, with the TitleId being a Link.  

The TitleId link then navigates to FetchTitleData, have the DetailsAsync
executed, then render the detail result view.

The search value is not getting to FetchTitles component.
It has all been coded, but not tested past that.

At this point, these notes are on the Home page also.
